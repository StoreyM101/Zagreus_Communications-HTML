Domain Name System (DNS) Protocol has been at the forefront of concern in Cyber Security with a plethora of attacks designed to maliciously abuse the protocol to perform illicit actions.
These files are one of three websites (Triton Banking, University Of Ares, Zagreus Communications) created for the purpose of building a secure, defensive, isolated network environment 
in order to analyse DNS attacks and hopefully produce a defensive outcome. This is one part of a much bigger project. In order to develop this isolated network, some DNS Servers (BIND9) 
and Web Servers (Apache2) have been configured in order to create some ethical, isolated website targets which could be used a safe targets that malicious DNS threat actors could try and exploit. 
These websites have been created in order to highlight how DNS attacks can affect a wide variety of different companies with different aims and objectives.

In this case, Zagreus Communications is a completely fake, simulated website which is designed to mimic a very basic but realistic Telecommunications company with an online website. 
Consequently, this website can be used as a safe target for conducting a variety of DNS attacks without needing any real-world registered domains with sensitive information.
